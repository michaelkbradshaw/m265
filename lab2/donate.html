    <h3> Our zoo is a non-profit organization and runs on donations from people like you. We put animals before profit. </h3>
    <p><b>What is your donation used for?</b> <br> We are an animal sanctuary. We are funded by donations.
        All of the purchases are used to ensure that we can provide all needs to the animals that we have rescued.
    </p>
      <p>You are not obligated to donate. We do appreciate all the support that we can get!</p>
